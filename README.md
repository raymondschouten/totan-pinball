# Tales of the Arabian Nights Pinball

I've always liked pinball machines ever since I was little, and whenever I had the opportunity to play at one, I did. Although I never understood what I was supposed to do in order to "play" the game. For me, keeping the balls in the game for as long as possible was challenging enough.

Everything changed for me, the moment I downloaded Pinball Arcade on my iPad, and played the _Tales of the Arabian Nights_ table for the first time. The lights, sounds, vocals, background music, gameplay, playfield... Really everything about this table got me hooked immediately.

Not so much later, I decided to build my own exact copy of the _Tales of the Arabian Nights_ pinball machine... from scratch! That would mean designing, woodworking, installing electronics, building circuit boards, programming the software, etc, with very limited knowledge about any of it. So I started to learn all about pinball machines by reading forums and watching videos on YouTube. Soon, I realized that the components on the playfield are really nothing more than leaf switches, coils, magnets and closed circuits.

I knew it would be a costly and time consuming project, but I really wanted to do it and share my enthusiasm with the world. Therefore all my information, designs and work can be read and found in this GitHub repository.
